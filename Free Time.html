	<h1> My Free Time</h1>
	
		<p> In my free time I like to spend on hang out with friends, listening to music and study about the lesson. For my holiday or at the weekend I often going on trip with my family. Mostly we went to the beach and sometimes to Siemreap Province. My family really love swimming. And for me also because the beach is fun and I can relax and enjoy the fresh air from ocean. The beach is so far from Phnom Penh, I spent 4 to 5 hours on car to reach there. On the ride my family always talk about fun things and what to once we arrived at the beach. When I was 15 year old I always rent the lifejacket to swim because I don't know how to swim. Now I don't need that anymore. </p>
