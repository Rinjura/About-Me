<h1> My Biggest Mistake </h1>
	
<p> I can learn a lot from my biggest mistakes. Here are a few examples:

I can learn to be more careful. When I make a mistake, I can reflect on what I did wrong and how I can avoid making the same mistake in the future.
I can learn to be more humble. Mistakes can remind me that I am not perfect and that I have more to learn.
I can learn to be more resilient. When I make a mistake, I can pick myself up, learn from it, and move on.
I can learn to be more compassionate. When I see others make mistakes, I can be understanding and supportive, because I know how it feels. </p>
