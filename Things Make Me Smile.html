<h1> Things Make Me Smile </h1>
	
<p> here are many things make people smile. Even laughing. For me the things make me smile the most is seeing someone appreciate me after I helping them. Also the person who value me like my friends and never judge the appearance or where I come from. When I do something  good also make me smile. Talk to my friends also make me smile</p>
